		<h2>My Bonsai Stories</h2>
			<h3>Gimil’s Story</h3>
				<p>I found Gimil one day when I was looking for a small Rosemary tree for Christmas. He was tucked in a corner with a bunch of reduce tagged plants that were dying. Gimil was a type of Bonsai I have never seen before. It was planted in a container within another container. When I took him home I was able to transplant him into another pot. I was scared that Gimil was going to die in this process, but I was very careful with his roots. He has recently sprouted some small flowers to my surprise.

			<h3>Groot’s Story</h3>
				<p>This was my first Bonsai. I found him at local hardware store at full price. Groot taught me that every Bonsai is different in their own way. For the longest time I was not giving him enough sunlight and he almost died. When I first got him, his branches were all sticking up like a bush. Now he has mellowed out into a small tree of his own. At one point he caught a bug that made his branches white. I stop watering him for a few days and put him outside. Within a week he was back to normal. I have had Groot for almost 3 years now.
