		<h2>Personal Bonsai Daily Care Routine</h2>
			<p>This routine was developed by almost killing my first Bonsai <b>(Groot)</b> due to over watering and pruning.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Touch the soil and in some cases pinch the dirt to see if it is moist.</li>
					<li>Visually inspect the Bonsai and make mental notes of how it looks that day.</li>
					<li>Water every other day depending on the soil moisture, which depends on the temperature inside the apartment. I only use unfiltered water. Some times when it rains I have a few glass jars outside that I use to collect water to use.</li>
					<li>Rotate position of pot every day.</li>
					<li>Clean up any fallen leaves and make note of such event.</li>
					<li>Remove with scissors any dead branches a few times a year, usually in the winter season.</li>
					<li>Place my Bonsai outside depending on the temperature, usually if itâ€™s 60-80F.</li>
				</ol>
